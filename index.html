          Having spend many years indulging in vocational interests, it has become apparent that web development and software programming is at the center of many personal interests and strengths. The love of art and creation, critical thinking, as well as
          problem solving all fall within the realm of coding. This new found passion for web development is a culmination of life lessons that have shown there are many reasons why I will both be successful at coding and find fulfillment from the career.
